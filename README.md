# Artwork Twitter Bot (Roxalisgh)

This is the source code for a twitter bot that publishes public domain artwork and artwork information randomly and regularly. The scheduling mechanism is not part of the code and scheduling must be initiated through (non)-commercial programs or the operating system (server). Also, the data file with tweets and artwork links is not part of the code. The bot can be found [here](https://twitter.com/roxalisgh).
